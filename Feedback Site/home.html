			<h2>Explanation</h2>
			<p>Hello, I'm conducting research into Algorithmic Music Composition and whether or not it's possible to create reasonably similar compositions using an imitation focused algorithm. The main set of questions will ask you to decide which of two audio samples is closer to the original. 

			After this an additional, optional set of questions will be asked with more general questions. You do not have to answer these questions.</p>
